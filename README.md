# loanproject

It is an app that allows authenticated users to go through a loan application. It contains “amount required” and “loan term.” All the loans will be assumed to have a “weekly” repayment frequency. After the loan is approved, the user must be able to submit the weekly loan repayments. It can be a simplified repay functionality, which won’t need to check if the dates are correct but will just set the weekly amount to be repaid.
